# OverCloudAirways: A Collaborative Learning Platform for a DDD application

Welcome to **OverCloudAirways**! This project serves as a collaborative learning platform for developers interested in exploring cutting-edge technologies, architectural patterns, and best practices in software development. Inspired by flight booking systems, the primary focus is on providing a comprehensive sample for developers to study, contribute, and learn from.

OverCloudAirways showcases _serverless_ technologies and core architectural patterns, including **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **CQRS**, **Microservices**, and **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**. We emphasize that these technologies and patterns are not a silver bullet, and the decisions made in this project depend on multiple factors. Our goal is to create a resource that encourages collaboration and helps developers improve their skills, explore new ideas, and gain insights into building modern, scalable, and maintainable enterprise applications.

**Your contributions are welcome!** Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer, we invite you to join us in our quest to learn and share knowledge about building better software.

## Architecture and Design

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

> "Domain-driven design is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain." - Eric Evans, author of the book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"

OverCloudAirways employs Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to build a solid foundation for the system's architecture. We chose DDD for this project because it provides a proven set of practices and patterns for tackling complexity in software systems, allowing us to create a maintainable and scalable solution that serves as a valuable learning resource for developers.

In our implementation of DDD, we focus on the following key aspects:

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Establishing a shared language among developers that promotes effective communication and a common understanding of the domain. Although we don't have real domain experts for this project, we strive to use consistent terminology and naming conventions that accurately represent domain concepts.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Defining logical boundaries that separate different areas of the domain, promoting modularity and limiting the scope of domain models.
- **Aggregates**: Designing consistent clusters of domain objects (entities and value objects) that are treated as a single unit and enforcing business rules within these aggregates.
- **Domain Events**: Capturing and communicating significant state changes in the domain through events, allowing for better decoupling between components.
- **Domain Services**: Encapsulating domain-specific logic that doesn't naturally fit within aggregates or value objects.

Since we use event-sourcing in OverCloudAirways, we don't have traditional repositories. Instead, we store and retrieve the state of aggregates by replaying domain events.

By adhering to DDD principles, OverCloudAirways aims to provide a maintainable and scalable solution that serves as a valuable learning resource for developers.
