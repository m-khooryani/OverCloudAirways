# OverCloudAirways: A Collaborative Learning Platform for a DDD application

Welcome to **OverCloudAirways**! This project serves as a collaborative learning platform for developers interested in exploring cutting-edge technologies, architectural patterns, and best practices in software development. Inspired by flight booking systems, the primary focus is on providing a comprehensive sample for developers to study, contribute, and learn from.

OverCloudAirways showcases _serverless_ technologies and core architectural patterns, including **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **CQRS**, **Microservices**, and **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**. We emphasize that these technologies and patterns are not a silver bullet, and the decisions made in this project depend on multiple factors. Our goal is to create a resource that encourages collaboration and helps developers improve their skills, explore new ideas, and gain insights into building modern, scalable, and maintainable enterprise applications.

**Your contributions are welcome!** Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer, we invite you to join us in our quest to learn and share knowledge about building better software.
